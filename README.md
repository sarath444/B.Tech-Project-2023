### Project Title: Analyzing Drought Resistance In Crops Using Thermal Imaging
<p align= "justify">
This project focuses on using UAVs with thermal cameras to assess drought resistance in wheat varieties under deficit irrigation. Deficit irrigation is a common water-saving technique used when water resources are limited, but it can lead to drought stress and decreased crop yield. Therefore, the identification of suitable wheat varieties for maximizing yield under different degrees of deficit irrigation is crucial, particularly in drought-prone or semi-arid areas. UAVs with a thermal camera can obtain thermal imagery which has a sub-meter spatial resolution, So it makes it possible to accurately obtain canopy temperature even at high altitudes and in a short time. With these advantages, UAV thermal infrared images can quickly assess the spatial temperature situation of crops and then estimate the water stress status of crops. Moreover, UAV thermal infrared images were used to evaluate and rank the physiological performance of different wheat genotypes under moderate and high salty treatments, successfully identifying the salt tolerance of each genotype. However, UAV thermal infrared imagery has widely been used, especially in the field of stress monitoring and variety identification. In contrast, little is known about the identification of the drought resistance of wheat varieties in different deficit-irrigation regimes.

### Project Title: Paddy Leaf Disease Detection Using Thermal Images and Deep Learning Algorithms
<p align= "justify">
Paddy leaf diseases are a major threat to rice production, causing significant yield losses. Traditional methods for disease detection are labour-intensive and time-consuming, and they often cannot detect diseases early enough to take effective action. This study presents an innovative approach for paddy leaf disease detection using thermal imaging and deep learning algorithms. Thermal imaging can capture temperature variations in paddy leaves, which can be used to identify the presence and severity of diseases. Deep learning 
algorithms, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can be used to classify diseases based on their thermal signatures. The proposed methodology involves collecting thermal images of healthy and diseased paddy leaves. These images are preprocessed to enhance quality, and then a CNN-based deep learning model is trained to distinguish between healthy and diseased leaves. Performance evaluation on a comprehensive dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach, achieving high accuracy in detecting various paddy leaf diseases.

### Project Title: Precision Agriculture: Thermal Imaging for Sapota Ripeness
<p align= "justify">
Thermal imaging is a promising technology with various applications, including non-destructive assessment of fruit ripeness. This project aims to develop a novel approach using thermal imaging to accurately determine the ripeness of fruits, with a focus on peach and sapota (chikoo). By capturing thermal images of fruits at different stages of ripeness, we create a diverse dataset for training and testing a machine-learning model. The dataset is preprocessed and annotated with corresponding ripeness labels, facilitating supervised learning. Advanced image processing techniques are employed to enhance relevant features in the thermal images, with temperature as the primary indicator of ripeness. The project leverages deep learning algorithms to train a model capable of classifying fruits as
underripe, ripe, or overripe based on thermal images. The model's performance is rigorously evaluated on a separate testing dataset to ensure accurate and reliable results. We address the need for real-time applications by considering the implementation of the trained model on a thermal imaging system in a production or distribution line. To ensure ethical considerations, data collection is done responsibly, and participant consent is obtained when applicable. Moreover, the project acknowledges the influence of environmental factors on thermal readings and implements calibration procedures to maintain accuracy. While thermal imaging provides valuable insights into fruit ripeness, we acknowledge that additional factors like aroma, texture, and color might also influence the assessment. As such, this project complements existing methodologies for fruit ripeness detection, offering a non-invasive and potentially automated solution. By combining expertise from computer vision, machine learning, agriculture, and food science, this research contributes to the advancement of fruit quality assessment methods. The results are expected to have implications for fruit producers, distributors, and consumers, enhancing decision-making processes throughout the supply chain. The novelty of our approach lies in its non-destructive nature, enabling fruits to remain intact and suitable for consumption after assessment. Ultimately, this project seeks to bridge the gap between cutting-edge technology and the agriculture industry, fostering sustainable and efficient practices for fruit ripeness evaluation.
