### Project Title: Analyzing Drought Resistance In Crops Using Thermal Imaging
<p align= "justify">
This project focuses on using UAVs with thermal cameras to assess drought resistance in wheat varieties under deficit irrigation. Deficit irrigation is a common water-saving technique used when water resources are limited, but it can lead to drought stress and decreased crop yield. Therefore, the identification of suitable wheat varieties for maximizing yield under different degrees of deficit irrigation is crucial, particularly in drought-prone or semi-arid areas. UAVs with a thermal camera can obtain thermal imagery which has a sub-meter spatial resolution, So it makes it possible to accurately obtain canopy temperature even at high altitudes and in a short time. With these advantages, UAV thermal infrared images can quickly assess the spatial temperature situation of crops and then estimate the water stress status of crops. Moreover, UAV thermal infrared images were used to evaluate and rank the physiological performance of different wheat genotypes under moderate and high salty treatments, successfully identifying the salt tolerance of each genotype. However, UAV thermal infrared imagery has widely been used, especially in the field of stress monitoring and variety identification. In contrast, little is known about the identification of the drought resistance of wheat varieties in different deficit-irrigation regimes.
